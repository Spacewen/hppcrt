
HPPC tries to be open but sometimes people will have very specific
needs or wishes that are hard to accomodate in the main code line.
Here is a list of "friends" -- forks which implement certain features
or aspects that didn't make it into HPPC but are still worth 
investigating (perhaps they'll be more useful to you than HPPC itself!).

* HPPC-RT (by Vincent Sonnier), https://github.com/vsonnier/hppc
  A fork for real-time HPPC, minimizes allocations, introduces cool 
  overhead-less iterators and other miscellaneous goodies.

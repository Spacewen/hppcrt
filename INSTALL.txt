Hacking HPPC-RT:
----------------
The project as a whole requires Java 8, although the final runtime jar is still Java 5 compatible. To assure such 
antiquated compatibility, some restrictions must be enforced:

* hppcrt (sources) : Runtime sources either templates or hand-coded must use 1.5 API at best, although the language constructs could be up to Java 8. (lambdas...)
Then, the Retrolambda plugin translates Java 8 language constructs to 1.5 language ones, and finally
the strict 1.5 API compatibility is checked by the animal-sniffer plugin before building the runtime jar.

* hppcrt (tests): templates and hand-coded tests are allowed to be fully 1.8 compatible, including the API.

* hppcrt-template-processor: allowed to be fully Java 8 compatible, including the API.
* hppcrt-benchmarks: allowed to be fully Java 8 compatible, including the API.

# Clean everything
mvn clean

# Generate Eclipse project files (the setup is a bit complex, so use this!)
mvn clean compile eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse

# Compile 
mvn clean compile

# Compile all, run all unit tests
mvn clean test

# Build sources jar.
mvn source:jar

# Package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, skip the tests execution.
mvn clean package -Pquick

# Compile all, run all unit tests, package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, install packages in a local repository.
mvn clean install

# Compile all, package all JAR files, builds the benchmarks jar, skip the tests execution, install packages in a local repository.
mvn clean install -Pquick

# Compile all, create benchmark JAR only
mvn clean package -Pquicknodoc -am -pl :hppcrt-benchmarks

# List available benchmarks

# Try to resolve all dependencies to be able to work off the Net
mvn dependency:go-offline

# Use -Pquick to skip tests execution,
# and replace -Pquick by -Pquicknodoc to also skip Javadoc generation.

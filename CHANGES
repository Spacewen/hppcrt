
[0.5.0-SNAPSHOT]
http://issues.carrot2.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10070&version=10321

** API-breaking changes:

HPPC-66: allow retrieving key instances by key-equality from Object*Map versions of 
         hash maps. Renamed lget in KTypeOpenHashSet to lkey for consistency. 
         So, the methods accessing last found key in sets and maps are: 
         lget (maps, accesses last value), lset (maps, accesses last value), 
         lkey (maps, sets, accesses last key), lslot (both, slot index).

HPPC-68: Lifted final markers on public methods

** New features

HPPC-63: a jdk15-compatible artifact is being published to Maven Central now.

HPPC-66: allow retrieving key instances by key-equality from Object*Map versions of 
         hash maps and hash sets.

HPPC-69: added toString to cursors.

HPPC-77: BitSet should use hotspot intrinsics (popcnt mostly)

** Bug fixes

HPPC-65: putOrAdd uses == for comparing object keys instead of equality

HPPC-72: XorShiftRandom always returns a zero. [Sergey Peretyatko] 
         This class was used only in benchmarks and tests so unless
         you're using it directly you're not affected.
         
HPPC-73: get, contains and any other method may block indefinitely with 
         high load factors and full storage array capacity

HPPC-74: Load factor is not used in KTypeOpenHashSet

HPPC-75: put or add may leave the internal state of the hash containers 
         inconsistent on OOM conditions

** Other

Added newInstance() to BitSet and IntDoubleLinkedSet for consistency.

[0.4.0] 
http://issues.carrot2.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10070&version=10210

** API-breaking changes:

HPPC-60: Cleaned up the code of all iterators (including some name/scope changes
         of iterator classes, so if you relied on these, things may break).

HPPC-59: keySet() renamed to keys() on associative containers. 

HPPC-46: toArray() on object types must return actual T[], not Object[]

HPPC-52: Dropped custom hash functions and comparators from associative containers
         for speed reasons.

** New features

HPPC-61: Cleaned up Maven structure: parent aggregator and submodules.

HPPC-57: Added a view of values to associative containers (values() method).

HPPC-49: Added support for XorShift random.

HPPC-34: Added support for Cloneable.

HPPC-51: Replace double hashing in open hash map/set to linear probing and a good 
         hashing function to ensure random distribution of elements

HPPC-47: Changed the implementation of MurmurHash to MurmurHash3, impl.
         borrowed from Sebastiano Vigna's fastutil library. [ASL]

** Bug fixes

HPPC-46: toArray() on object types must return actual T[], not Object[]

** Other

HPPC-58: Better integration with Eclipse, new template->code generation.

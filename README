HPPC: High Performance Primitive Collections "plus"
---------------------------------------------------

This is a fork of HPPC from Carrot Search:
see JavaDoc and documentation at: http://labs.carrotsearch.com/hppc.html for more info.

IMPORTANT: Developers - read INSTALL file for proper Eclipse setup!

This fork intend to follow the original HPPC as close as possible (currently in v0.6 dev) while 
adding some more features which general goal is improving realtime behaviour, 
that is among others, to have ZERO GC at runtime.

For now, the additional features are:
- Custom HashingStrategy for HashMaps/HashSets, to override the usual equals()/hashCode(). 
- Faster clear(), resize() and such, using a memcpy-like technique offering 2x speed gain in clear() like operations,
especially noticable for big container sizes. (Javolution has a similar trick)

In a near future:
- Pooled Iterators: ability to use iterators the usual way, without creating Iterator instances
dynamically under the hood. 
In particular using the for-each construct without any allocation of new iterator instances, transparently.

Binaries, sources and Javadoc, are provided in the 'hppc/binaries' of the '0.6.x_plus' branch for convenience.
